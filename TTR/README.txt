To make the randomizer work make sure to have the Start.bat file and the TTR.Jar file in the same folder.

To run the App on windows you just need to double click the Start.bat file.

To run the App on linux/mac you just need to double click the Start.command file.

By default the ttrSettings file isn't there but as soon as you run the app it gets created in the same directory(folder) where you have the Start.bat and the TTR.jar files.

Opening the ttrSettings file with a text editor(for example notepad) allows you to edit configurations for the randomizer.

In case the settings written in the ttrSettings file do not respect the constraints, the program will use the default settings(same as when the file gets first created).

In case the app stops working and its not clear why it does, a good way to fix it is to just delete the ttrSettings file and restart the app.


If the app fails to start and an error like this pops up:
"org/liuk/Main has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 61.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to X"
That means your Java installation is not recent enough to support the app as it was compiled with jdk-17.
Here's a link to the jdk-17: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17.
